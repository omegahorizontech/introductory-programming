# Introductory Programming
Introductory Programming describes a variety of general topics within computer science.

You should be able to self teach after you complete our `Initial Education Plan`. See the `Other Learning Resources` section at the bottom this document for more info. We don't want to reinvent what's already available on the Internet - we'd rather refer you to resources that have worked for us.

Our primary goal is to make it possible for you to learn on your own. We want you to work on projects that you think are meaningful. Most importantly, we want programming to be fun for you, too!

### Initial Education Plan
##### Getting Started, Hello World!
  - [Hello World](https://github.com/omegahorizontech/introductory-programming/blob/master/lessons/Hello%20World.md)
    - Topics: Python Installation, Python, Hello World Example, Operating System Concept
  - [Install An IDE](https://github.com/omegahorizontech/introductory-programming/blob/master/lessons/Install%20An%20IDE.md)
  - python math, compound interest
  - introduction to GitHub
  - guess high or low game

##### Modern Programming Concepts
  - install PIP and pipenv (explain side note about virtual env)
  - make python flask server run
  - basic html hello world
  - ajax query to python server, GET a sample JSON object with multiple compound interest outcomes, - POST input field returns compound interest, also could do a POST for the game

##### Challenge Accepted!
  - jupyter notebook
  - scikit learn
  - CSV files
  - Supervised, Unsupervised (work with Brian on this)
  - Data Visualization in Jupyter
  - D3js (start with simple scatter plot)

### Further topics to consider (for the future)
  - Intermediate/Advanced Data Science
  - Intermediate/Advanced Machine Learning
  - Intermediate/Advanced Application Development
    - React Application Development (Basic CRUD)
    - Angular Application Development (Basic CRUD)
  - Introductory Cybersecurity
  - Introductory DevOps
  - Introductory Mobile Development
    - Android Application Development

### Other Learning Resources
_We don't want to reinvent what's already available on the Internet. These resources are free once you setup an account:_
 - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
  - A free education source for more than just programming
 - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  - A forum for asking questions, also often the result of a Google search

_These sites contain free courses once you create an account. They have business models that rely on people paying for courses, too:_
 - [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
  - Provides certification in the form of Nanodegrees, and assists you with starting your GitHub presence
 - [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  - Gives you badges as a way of demonstrating skills learned, encourages portfolio building
